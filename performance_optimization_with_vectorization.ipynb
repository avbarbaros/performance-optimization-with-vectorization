        "### Problem Description:\n",
        "We're simulating **2D heat diffusion** using the finite difference method. This is a common problem in computational physics where heat spreads through a 2D material over time. The heat equation governs how temperature changes at each point based on the temperature of neighboring points.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Physical Background:\n",
        "The 2D heat equation is: ∂T/∂t = α(∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y²)\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- T is temperature at each point\n",
        "- α is the thermal diffusivity coefficient\n",
        "- We discretize space into a grid and time into steps\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Code is Slow:\n",
        "The original implementation uses nested Python loops to iterate through every grid point, which is very inefficient. Python loops have significant overhead compared to compiled operations, making this approach much slower than necessary for numerical computations."

        "\n",
        "1. **Triple nested loops in `heat_diffusion_unoptimized`**: The innermost operation is executed `num_iterations × (rows-2) × (cols-2)` times. For a 50×50 grid with 200 iterations, this means approximately 460,800 iterations through Python's interpreter loop, which is extremely slow.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Array copying in every iteration**: The line `new_grid = current_grid.copy()` creates a full copy of the array 200 times, which involves significant memory allocation and copying overhead.\n",

        "Python loops are interpreted, meaning each iteration involves:\n",

        "- **Benchmark iteratively**: Test performance at each optimization step to verify improvements and catch regressions\n",
        "- **Maintain correctness**: Always verify that optimized code produces identical results to the original implementation\n",
